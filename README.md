# Unexpected PHP Array Key Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important aspect of PHP's array handling. PHP arrays are not always ordered numerically as one might initially assume.  This can lead to unexpected results if not carefully considered.

The `bug.php` file contains code that illustrates this behavior. The `bugSolution.php` file offers a corrected approach.

This is a common pitfall for PHP developers, especially those transitioning from languages with strictly ordered arrays or dictionaries.
